### Data + Acute
The [Free On-Line Dictionary Of Computing](http://foldoc.org/) includes this comment about *data* (it appears in the entry for *[information](http://foldoc.org/information)*:
>"People or computers can find patterns in data to perceive information, and information can be used to enhance knowledge. Since knowledge is prerequisite to wisdom, we always want more data and information. But, as modern societies verge on information overload, we especially need better ways to find patterns." Â© Denis Howe (@denishowe)

To be acute is to be marked by keen discernment or intellectual perception, especially of subtle distinctions. "Cute", the abbreviated version of the word, has come to mean both shrewd and attractively small.

The portmanteau word *Datacute* has been chosen to represent my specialty: producing efficient tools and systems to assist with incisive data analysis.

### Contents
There is currently nothing to read, download, or comment on at this site, apart from this growing list of posts, as I convert them from Wordpress:

{% for post in site.posts %}
[{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }})
{% endfor %}
