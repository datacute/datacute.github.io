<p>Here are some improvements to JDT Project in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/galileo/">Galileo</a> that I personally find useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support for <code>{@inheritDoc}</code> in the javadoc popups.
<ul>
<li>This is encourages its use, which in turn encourages documenting <em>why</em> a method has been overridden, or what's so special about this particular implementation, without having to repeat the purpose of the method itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warnings when a method overrides a synchronized method, but isn’t synchronized itself.
<ul>
<li>It’s hard enough as it is to ensure you get the intended multi-threaded behaviour. This change can help prevent an error that while not very common, can be very hard to spot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When auto-reformatting an entire class, I can keep the line breaks that I’ve added.
<ul>
<li>This caters for where the formatting rules are too general, and are not aware that I’d find some things much clearer if split into multiple lines in very specific places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Constructor completion has been made more useful, by offering more appropriate suggestions.
<ul>
<li>I also often save myself some typing by writing the right hand side of the assignment, then using a quick assist to assign the result to a new variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By holding down Ctrl, and hovering on a method, I can chose whether to jump to the declaration, or the implementation.
<ul>
<li>I still find this method of navigation difficult though, preferring to keep my hands on the keyboard, navigating to the method call, pressing Ctrl-T, and choosing which implementing or declaring class I wish to view. (That’s not a new feature.)</li>
<li>What I’d like is a companion for F3’s mapping of “Go To Declaration” that with a single key press I can “Go To Implementation”. However I can’t find that command in the key binding preferences page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
