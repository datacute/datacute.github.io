There's a common High-voltage Serial Programmer circuit online for resetting fuses on the ATtiny85 (and similar). They use a 12V power supply, which I don't have. I decided to experiment using a cheap DC/DC converter.

<!--more-->

### What for?

The ATtiny85 chip only has 8 pins, two of which are used for power and ground.

One of those pins can used to reset the ATtiny85, or by changing 'fuses', can be another general purpose Input/Output pin. However if that pin function is changed, the ATtiny85 can no longer be re-programmed.

Other fuses control the clock source, and when experimenting with some of my ATtiny85 chips, I had inadvertantly set them up to require clocks that meant my programmer could no longer communicate with the chips.

A 'High-voltage Serial Programmer' (HVP or HVSP) allows these otherwise bricked chips to have their fuses reset, allowing them to then be re-programmed.

They're called 'High Voltage' because a 12V signal needs to be supplied to the `Reset` pin to put it in High-voltage Serial Programming mode.

### DC/DC Converter

The converter I had was a B0512S-1W, which created a 12V power supply from a 5V input.
This is probably a bad option, as we're only using the 12V as a signal, and not drawing much power from it. One of the datasheets I found for it says ...

>this product should never be operated under no load! If the
actual output power is very small, please connect a resistor with proper
resistance at the output end in parallel to increase the load, or use our
companyâ€™s products with a lower rated output power (B_S(D) -0.25W Series).

However, it was cheaper than any 12V power supplies I could find, so I thought I would give it a go.

I'm left wondering though - is there a better option than the B0512S? Should I introduce artificial load? What happens with next to no load?

### Breadboarding

I tried it out on a bread board, with an Arduino UNO as the controller. I used the same pins as I'd seen in the circuit diagrams online, using the UNO board's pins 8 to 13.

**It worked!**

### Design

So, I designed a layout for a prototype board, shaped to sit on top of an Arduino UNO.

(The 4 pin socket at the bottom is the B0512S-1W.)

### Build

I was thinking that the resistor legs would be long enough to go from Arduino UNO pin 9 to ATtiny socket pin 5, however I forgot that when I soldered them at the top by the pins and consequently had to use some additional wires and joins. I rearranged the Fritzing design afterwards to look more like what I had built.

I added the button after taking these photos. The purpose of the button is to allow resetting fuses without having to control the UNO from my laptop.

### Test

**It didn't work!**

I had had it working on a breadboard though!

### Debug

I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to figure out how come the device signature wasn't reading correctly:

*Is the Attiny85 completely bricked?*
- No, I get the same behaviour with known good devices that can still be identified as ATtiny85 devices and re-programmed after having been in my High-voltage Serial Programmer.
- I did read all the code a good number of times, and examined the relevant datasheet, learning a lot about high-voltage serial programming, but not discovering any reason why mine might not be working.
- The signature was being read as FFFF. I changed the code to ignore the signature, but then the fuse values were being read as FF, and any attempt to write different values had no effect on the ATtiny85.

*Is sharing pin 13 with the built-in LED on the UNO a problem?*
- I don't think so - but **if you're building your own I recommend using a different pin to control the 12V signal.** The built-in LED on my UNO is underneath the prototype board, but its light shines through the holes in the prototype board. The sketch I was using was turning the LED on and off, but even with that code commented out, the problem remained.

*Is the transistor wired in the correct way around?*
- Yes. I *think* so. It's a 2N2222A, not a P2N2222A.

*Are any of my solder joints bad?*
- They're not pretty, but they all beep out ok.

*Why, when the 12V signal is switched on, does the ATtiny85's `Reset` pin only get about 7.5V?*
- This is definitely a problem. The B0512S-1W is putting out a steady voltage of about 12.5V, which is at the high end of what the ATtiny85 will accept for a 12V signal.

*Is the transistor broken, and I'm getting a voltage divider circuit between the 12V supply and the 5V on pin 13?*
- I tried testing the voltage drops across the transistor pins, though with the transistor in circuit rather than removed. I've never done this before, and I think that the diode testing portion of my multi-meter can do this. There was one unusual reading - the emitter to collector voltage drop was 2V rather than OL. I don't know if this indicates that there is anything wrong with the transistor.

Eventually I found the cause, and if you know what you are looking for, you can see it in the image above -- I had completely missed wiring the ATtiny's ground connection! With that fixed...

**It works!**.
