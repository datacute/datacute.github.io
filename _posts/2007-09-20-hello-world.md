This is my first post. It was created automatically by WordPress, but I've edited it.

When starting to edit it, I was trying to decide whether to change the title. WordPress had given it the title "Hello world!", which I had used as the title for the first entry in my son's blog, announcing his birth. I think that blog post deserved such a title, but this one doesn't. Such a title doesn't convey any details about the contents of what I'm writing here. No one is going to have their curiosity piqued by a WordPress blog post titled "Hello world!". So I changed it.
